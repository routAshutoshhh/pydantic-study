This is the code for practicing making models using pydantic to concrete my understanding over using pydantic and hence to make the coding in fast api and fast mcp better

learning the following things while coding in pydantic and making pydantic class models

1.  making foundational base models
2.  doing validation and putting constraints using feilds
3.  understanding model behaviour
